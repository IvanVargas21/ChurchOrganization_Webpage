# ChurchOrganization_Webpage
A collaborative project for our Software Engineering course introducing React and GitHub. My contributions include a basic chatbot about Christ the Living Stone Fellowship, an embedded video, a donation section using EmailJS, and a carousel of images showcasing the church.
